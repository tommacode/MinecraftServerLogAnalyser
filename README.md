# Minecraft Server Log tools

## How to use

1. Download and unzip the code.
2. Get the log file that you would like to use. If there are multiple files then upload it to some file combiner service
3. Place the log file in the same folder as the .py file(s)
4. Open the .py file and change the file name that will be opened (normally at the top of the code) to whatever the file you added was called
   Note: I will make a way where the user can just enter the file name and it will open it for them when they run the program.
5. Run the program.

## Known Issues

- I am investingating an issue where if a player plays past midnight the time that they have played for may not be accurate.
